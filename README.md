- “I don’t expect anything really fancy. No functionality, put that in the Jawas system you are making instead. The website should just have some info about our fitness centre to attract new customers, some info about who we are, the various activities we offer, where to find us, and so on, I’m sure you know the kind of website I’m talking about.”

**Website layout (pages):**
- 1 Index (All relevant events & news for customers)

## Java Project Side:

*General observations:
Misunderstanding and miscommunication are often encountered problems in normal teams. In multicultural teams, these are considerably more noticeable due to a fundamental difference in communication habits between cultures.*

*After having worked as a sales executive in 6 countries, in locations such as Dubai Mall where a mix of culture is a culture in itself, and after having watched the recommended videos: I have formed 3 important conclusions:
Procedures and rules should be in place for everything that may cause a drawback in the team performance.
Good communication does not mean friendship and friendship does not mean good communication. The worst thing that can happen to a team will not happen in the initial stages of its formation but in the later. Usually, team members begin to assume they know each other well enough to predict and thus avoid communicating.
Adequate punishment is more difficult to implement that adequate rewarding, many teams suffocate due to either non-existent or incorrect punishment.*



### Background description
- 1 page –What does the customer want to do
- Do not mention solution
- Need at least 3 references (prepare questions for librarian)
- Current system that are already on the market (do not mention how you will be different in here)


**IMPORTANT:**
- What I would like from you is a system that runs on a single computer at the front desk, NOT ONLINE, we prefer being in direct contact with the members when they sign up.

- We don’t want passwords and logins and things like that for the system - it will just slow down our work

- The owner has recently decided to start preparing for retirement, by leaving the daily management to his son, former spinning instructor superstar, Bob Sixpack

- Mr. Sixpack wants to move VIAFit into the digital age, by replacing his father’s old-fashioned way of managing the centre, with a new management software system.  

- It’s a small fitness centre

- We have a group of loyal members, who are happy with what we provide, and most people stay as members for several years

- Payments are handled though a different system that even my father had to accept to start using a few years ago, so you don’t have to worry about that part in your system.

- Standard looking program that we can use with a keyboard and mouse, has save & search

- I would like it to be ready in the beginning of June.



**On a virtual whiteboard:**
- What I need from you is a software system that we can use to store all the information that we have.
- keep information about the instructors working at the fitness centre, and the members of the centre  keep track of the various    classes our instructors teach at the centre
- We list which classes will run at which days, and at which time, so the members will know when to show up. Furthermore, we add the name of the instructor who will teach each class, so that the instructors can take a look to know when to show up for work
- I would like to be able to use the system you are making to register the date and time that a class will run, and the instructor teaching it
- I would definitely like to be able to add new classes to the system, when needed.
- we have two different kinds of memberships
    o	regular membership for €19 per month, which allows the member to use all the equipment at the centre
    o	premium membership for €29, which also allows the member to sign up for the classes. 
  •	Sometimes a regular member will ask whether they can also sign up for a class, and we are actually thinking about maybe allowing them to do that in the future, by paying a fee for each class they sign up for. For now, the only way is for them to upgrade to the premium membership instead, and we are okay with that solution at the moment

Sign up for classes (process):
  •	“They talk to the receptionist at the front desk
  •	if the class is not already full, then they are added to the list of participants, which you have probably already guessed is stored on a piece of paper

    o	spinning classes we are limited by how many bikes we have, only 10 at the moment

    o	I suppose the maximum number of participants is something it would also be nice to be able to state when I add a new class to the system.
