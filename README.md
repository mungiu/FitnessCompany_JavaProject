## Java Project Side:

*General observations:
Misunderstanding and miscommunication are often encountered problems in normal teams. In multicultural teams, these are considerably more noticeable due to a fundamental difference in communication habits between cultures.*

*After having worked as a sales executive in 6 countries, in locations such as Dubai Mall where a mix of culture is a culture in itself, and after having watched the recommended videos: I have formed 3 important conclusions:
Procedures and rules should be in place for everything that may cause a drawback in the team performance.
Good communication does not mean friendship and friendship does not mean good communication. The worst thing that can happen to a team will not happen in the initial stages of its formation but in the later. Usually, team members begin to assume they know each other well enough to predict and thus avoid communicating.
Adequate punishment is more difficult to implement that adequate rewarding, many teams suffocate due to either non-existent or incorrect punishment.*




### Background description

- 1 page –What does the customer want to do
- Do not mention solution
- Need at least 3 references (prepare questions for librarian)
- Current system that are already on the market (do not mention how you will be different in here)

**IMPORTANT:**

>49% of people in Denmark attend Gym (2016 data) - http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1536
>19% of people in Denmark Gym 5 or more times a week (2016 data) - http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1536
>26% of people in Denmark send 6 or more hours per week in gym (2016 data) - http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1536
>61% of people in Denmark participate in sporting activities (2016 data) - http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1536
>there are 4 Gyms in horsens (2018 data) - https://binged.it/2pe3LFE

- a system that runs on a single computer at the front desk, NOT ONLINE (we prefer being in direct contact with the members when they sign up)

- We don’t want passwords and logins

- It’s a small fitness centre

- most people stay as members for several years

- Payments are handled though a different system, you don’t have to worry about that part in your system.

- Standard looking program that we can use with a keyboard and mouse, and has save/search

- I would like it to be ready in the beginning of June.

**On a virtual whiteboard:**
- What I need from you is a software system that we can use to store all the information that we have.
- keep information about the instructors working at the fitness centre, and the members of the centre
- keep track of the various    classes our instructors teach at the centre
- We list which classes will run at which days, and at which time, so the members will know when to show up. Furthermore, we add the name of the instructor who will teach each class, so that the instructors can take a look to know when to show up for work
- I would like to be able to use the system you are making to register the date and time that a class will run, and the instructor teaching it
- I would definitely like to be able to add new classes to the system, when needed.
- we have two different kinds of memberships: regular membership for €19 per month, which allows the member to use all the equipment at the centre and premium membership for €29, which also allows the member to sign up for the classes. 
- Sometimes a regular member will ask whether they can also sign up for a class, and we are actually thinking about maybe allowing them to do that in the future, by paying a fee for each class they sign up for. For now, the only way is for them to upgrade to the premium membership instead, and we are okay with that solution at the moment

**Sign up for classes (process):**
- “They talk to the receptionist at the front desk
- If the class is not already full, then they are added to the list of participants, which you have probably already guessed is stored on a piece of paper

**Fitness Member Data to register:**
- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Email
- Basic membership or premium membership
  
**Instructor data to register:**
- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Email
- Classes they can teach
  
**How many participants will be able to attend a class?**
 - varies from class to class
- spinning classes we are limited by how many bikes we have, only 10 at the moment
- Zumba we have room for a lot more people
- I suppose the maximum number of participants is something it would also be nice to be able to state when I add a new class to the system.

### Sources  references and literature
- Books, interviews, websites (type of source matters, diversity is key)




### Risk Assessment
- The most relevant risks for the project as you see it
EG: Experience from previous group work.
Outcome from reverse brainstor

**Determine:**
- How to identify these risks
- Action
- Who is respnsible

EG: Running out of time
How to ensure propper time management:
- setting goals
- reviewing progress
- prioritising
- organising work schedule
- managin with interruptions
